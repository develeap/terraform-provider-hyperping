# Development Archive

This directory contains historical development documents and progress reports that are kept for reference but not tracked in git.

These files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean while allowing developers to maintain local copies if needed.

## Contents

Historical documents may include:
- Phase completion reports (PHASE_*.md)
- Critical reviews (CRITICAL_REVIEW_*.md)
- Status reports (STATUS_*.md, *_PROGRESS.md)
- Action plans (ACTION_PLAN_*.md)
- Session summaries

## Purpose

These documents are useful for:
- Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- Reviewing past architectural decisions
- Learning from previous implementation attempts
- Providing context for current code structure

## Note

These files are intentionally not committed to git to avoid cluttering the repository history. Move relevant historical information to:
- `docs/adr/` for architectural decisions
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for current architecture
- `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing changes
