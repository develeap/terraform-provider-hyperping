# Debugging ISS-005, ISS-006, ISS-007 Fixes

## Issue
v1.0.4 release contains the fixes but tests show they're not working.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verify v1.0.4 Binary Contains Fixes

```bash
# Check the binary was built from the right commit
terraform-provider-hyperping version
# Should show v1.0.4

# Or check the actual binary
strings ~/.terraform.d/plugins/.../terraform-provider-hyperping_v1.0.4 | grep "Read full incident details"
```

### 2. Enable Debug Logging

```bash
export TF_LOG=DEBUG
export TF_LOG_PATH=terraform-debug.log
terraform apply
```

### 3. Check for Read-After-Create in Logs

Search the debug log for:
- `"Read full incident details"` - Should appear after create
- `GET /v3/incidents/{uuid}` - Should happen immediately after POST
- Response body from the GET request

### 4. Test API Directly

```bash
# Create an incident
curl -X POST https://api.hyperping.io/v3/incidents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": {"en": "Test Incident"},
    "text": {"en": "Testing API directly"},
    "type": "incident",
    "statuspages": ["sp_YOUR_STATUS_PAGE_UUID"]
  }'

# Note the UUID from response, then GET it
curl -X GET https://api.hyperping.io/v3/incidents/inci_XXXXX \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HYPERPING_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

**CRITICAL: Check what fields the GET response actually contains!**

## Suspected Root Cause

The Hyperping API's GET /v3/incidents/{uuid} might be returning:
1. Empty strings for title/text fields
2. Different field structure than we expect
3. Localized fields in a different format

## Questions

1. What does the GET /v3/incidents/{uuid} response look like?
2. Does it return `{"title": {"en": "..."}}` or something else?
3. Are there any errors in the Terraform debug log?

## Next Steps

Once we see the actual API response, we can fix the mapping logic.
